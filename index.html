      <!--<p><b>July 2019: I'm on the job market for machine learning positions in NYC! <a href="skills.html">Contact me</a>.</b></p>-->
      <p> Welcome! </p>
      <p> I currently work on machine learning research and engineering at Google. Previously, I worked on similar topics at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yihdong">Microsoft Research AI</a>. Before that, I was a software developer at Wolfram Research, working on large scale natural language processing and data mining of technical literature, primarily in math, using a variety of techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning, and creating scalable data processing and retrieval pipelines with e.g. Java, Python, and SQL.</p>

      <p>My interests primarily lie in two areas: <b>1)</b> develop efficient algorithms to understand and process high-dimensional, large-scale data, and <b>2)</b> build deep models to learn language and universal language-vision representations. </p>

      <p>Towards 1) I have developed algorithms for fast optimal transport, graph representation learning, efficient outlier detection in high dimensions, and methods for neural locality sensitive hashing. Towards 2) I have built various large-scale network architectures in NLP and text-image retrieval on web-scale data. In general I enjoy applying mathematical principles to improve model building. Please refer to <a href="pubs">my papers</a> for more details. At the moment I'm working on building universal vision-language representation models to improve core relevance algorithms for <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a>.</p>

<p>I studied math at Princeton (undergraduate) and the University of Wisconsin - Madison (graduate).</p>
      <p> I am also broadly interested in a wide range of current research developments in machine learning. I enjoy figuring out and implementing new algorithms. </p>
