      <!--<p><b>July 2019: I'm on the job market for machine learning positions in NYC! <a href="skills.html">Contact me</a>.</b></p>-->
      <p> Welcome! </p>
      <p> I currently work on machine learning research and engineering at <a href="https://research.google/people/YiheDong/">Google</a>, focusing on representation learning on structured data, automated feature engineering, and multimodal representation learning.
        Previously, I worked in similar areas at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yihdong">Microsoft Research AI</a>, such as building vision-language representation models to improve core relevance algorithms for <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a>.
        Before that, I worked at Wolfram Research on large scale natural language processing and data mining of technical literature.</p>

      <p>My interests primarily lie in: <b>1)</b> geometric representation learning,        
        and <b>2)</b> build deep models to learn language and multimodal representations. </p>

      <p>Towards 1) I have developed algorithms for fast optimal transport, graph representation learning, efficient outlier detection in high dimensions, and methods for neural locality sensitive hashing. Towards 2) I have designed and developed various large language models and multimodal representation models. In general, I enjoy applying mathematical principles to improve model building. <a href="pubs">My papers</a> contain more details on my research. </p>

<p>I studied math at Princeton (undergraduate) and the University of Wisconsin - Madison (graduate).</p>
      <p> I am also broadly interested in a wide range of current research developments in machine learning. I enjoy designing and implementing new models and algorithms. </p>
